SQL>1a) Load selected tables with your own additional test data using the supplied Q1a-tds-insert.sql script file, and the SQL
SQL>commands which will insert, as a minimum, the following sample data - 
SQL>20 OFFENCES
SQL>3 SUSPENSIONS
SQL>Please note, these are the minimum number of entries you must insert; you are encouraged to insert more to provide a richer data
SQL>set to draw from. 
SQL>For this task only, data that you add in the database should follow the rules mentioned below:
SQL>The primary key values for this data should be hardcoded values (i.e., not make use of sequences) and must consist of values
SQL>below 100.
SQL>Offences that you add must involve at least 12 different drivers. 
SQL>You must not add any offences for the following driver:
SQL>Lion Lawless of 72 Aberg Avenue Richmond South 3121 (Licence no.: 100389)
SQL>Dates used must be chosen between the 1st January 2016 and 30th June 2019. For each year from 2016 to 30th June 2019, you should
SQL>add at least 4 offences.
SQL>The suspensions you add in the database should not be in just one year, e.g., you should not add all the suspensions in 2018.
SQL>The suspensions you add in the database should not belong to just one driver, e.g., you should not add all the suspensions for
SQL>driver with licence number 100100.
SQL>A suspended driver cannot incur extra offences under this system while suspended. If a driver commits a driving offence while
SQL>suspended their vehicle is impounded and they are sent before the court (this means you must not add an offence to a suspended
SQL>driver until their suspension period has expired).
SQL>The supplied trigger shows the current total demerit points for a driver when you insert a new offence. You will need to run
SQL>your inserts one by one in date order, taking appropriate action if the drivers accumulated points pass the 12 demerit point
SQL>threshold. Each such entry should be treated as a separate transaction. An offence and any appropriate action that you may have
SQL>to take for this task must be managed as a transaction.
